# Recommendations for Potential Folk/Country Artists to Achieve Top Ratings on Pitchfork

The goal of our module 2 final project was to demonstrate our ability to gather information from a real-world database and use our knowledge of statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to generate analytical insights that can be meaningful to a company/stakeholder. From the dataset selection, we chose the Pitchfork music reviews dataset, which can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/nolanbconaway/pitchfork-data). The stakeholder scenario we decided to generate analytical insights for are new folk/country artists who would like to know how to get high ratings on [Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/), an influential American online music magazine. Ratings are measured by review score and best new music award.

## Data Processing
The dataset is provided as a sqlite database and includes tables for artists, content, genres, reviews, year, and labels. It consists of 18,393 reviews from January 5th, 1999 to January 8th, 2017.
